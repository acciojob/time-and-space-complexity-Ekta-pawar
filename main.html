	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. An algorithm with space complexity of O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the input.</p>
